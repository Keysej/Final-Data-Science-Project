📌 Overview

This final project consists of two parts:  
1. **Data Manifesto— a personal reflection on how I approach working with data  
2. Data Cookbook — a collection of code recipes demonstrating key data science skills I've learned this semester



Part 1: Data Manifesto

My Data Manifesto outlines the core principles that guide my work as a data scientist. It answers questions like:
- What is data, and how does it differ from facts or knowledge?
- What is the role of a data scientist?
- What skills and values are essential in doing data work?
- What are the limits of data science?

I reflect on themes like:
- The DIKW pyramid  
- The importance of context and ethics  
- What I bring personally to data science  
- How I apply these principles using examples from this course (including my Project 9 on Seattle crime data)

Part 2: Data Cookbook

The Data Cookbook includes 4+ practical "recipes" using Python, Pandas, GeoPandas, and Scikit-learn.  
Each recipe shows a useful technique I learned, using real data from the Seattle Open Data Portal.

| Recipe | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🧮 Top Crime Types | Count and plot most frequent crime categories |
| 📈 Crime vs Arrest Over Time | Create a stacked area chart with time series |
| 🗺️ Crime by Police Beat (Map) | Merge geospatial and tabular data with GeoPandas |
| 📊 Linear Regression Trendline | Model and interpret a trend using scikit-learn |
| 🔁 Two Ways to Count | Bonus recipe comparing two approaches for same task |
